# wumpusVGA
A version of the classic Hunt the Wumpus for VGA PC-Compatibles running DOS made in 2018, for some great anachronism

Mainly used the help of this book to understand how the VGA systems worked, really recommend it https://archive.org/details/BlackArt3DEBook

Compilation is done via OpenWatcom (I only tested v2, not sure if the older versions work) just run wmake and it *SHOULD* work.

There's a pre-compiled DOS executable on the releases folder that should work in good-old DosBox.

Thanks for playing/being interested in this software.
